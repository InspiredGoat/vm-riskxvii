# Have
- Loading blob
- Basic loop
- Instruction decode

# Missing
- Testing system
- Executing instructions
- Error handling

# Cool ideas
- remove branches in instruction_decode for checking names by just combining the OPCODE + FUNC3 + FUNC7 into a table
    - only do if performance is marked / rewarded
